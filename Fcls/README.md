# fcls: fancy clear screen

A silly program I made to play with pseudorandom number generation. The program produces a permutation of the integers [0, n)
where n is the number of characters viewable in the console window. It does not shuffle an array or use state to track numbers already picked. Also, even if n is the same for subsequent runs, the output sequence will likely be different. More comments are in main.cpp
